# "Lost on Pluto" (Terminal_Adventure)

Codex's "Terminal Adventure Game" is to create a terminal_game.py that walks the player through a
captivating mini-game adventure! In each step of the adventure,
the player should be presented with 2 or more options on where
to go next.

You are playing an astronaut who is discovering the surroundings on Pluto. The story is quite short, hope
you'll enjoy it though.
